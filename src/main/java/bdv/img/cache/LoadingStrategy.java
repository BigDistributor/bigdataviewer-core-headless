 * <ul>
 *   <li> {@link LoadingStrategy#VOLATILE}:
 *        Enqueue the cell for asynchronous loading by a fetcher thread.
 *   <li> {@link LoadingStrategy#BLOCKING}:
 *        Load the cell data immediately.
 *   <li> {@link LoadingStrategy#BUDGETED}:
 *        Load the cell data immediately if there is enough {@link IoTimeBudget}
 *        left for the current thread group. Otherwise enqueue the cell for
 *        asynchronous loading by a fetcher thread.
 *   <li> {@link LoadingStrategy#DONTLOAD}:
 *        Do nothing.
